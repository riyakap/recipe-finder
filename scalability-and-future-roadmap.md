**Status: Planning Complete**

### Core Features
- ✅ Ingredient input with smart suggestions
- ✅ Basic filtering (time, servings, diet)
- ✅ Recipe search and display
- ✅ Recipe detail modal
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Error handling and loading states

### Technical Foundation
- Static hosting (Netlify/Vercel)
- Frontend-only architecture
- Spoonacular API integration
- Local storage for caching
